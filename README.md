# Eruption Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying volcanic eruptions into different categories based on various geological and temporal features. The primary objective is to predict the eruption category (e.g., Confirmed, Uncertain, Discredited) using machine learning models.

## Dataset

https://data.world/jessymorgan25/volcanoeruptions/workspace/file?filename=eruptions.csv

The dataset contains information about volcanic eruptions, including numerical and categorical features such as:

Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)

Start Year, Month, and Day

Latitude and Longitude

Evidence Method Dating

Target Variable:

eruption_category: Categorizes eruptions into Confirmed, Uncertain, or Discredited.# ERUPTION-CLASSIFICATION

# Project Goals

Explore and visualize the data to understand relationships between features.

Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.

Build and evaluate machine learning models to classify eruption categories effectively.
